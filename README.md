This is the course project for CSCE 649.

It is implemented in Python 3.6.1. 

To run the code, you need to install 2 packages: numpy and pickle.

In the same directory where the provided code and data are, you can run the code:

$ python main.py

The codes are written in macOS environment. I'm not sure the instructions are right for Windows environment.
