This is the course project for CSCE 649.

It is implemented in Python 3.6.1. 

To run the code, you need to install 2 packages: numpy and pillow. Numpy is used for efficient numerical calculations, and pillow is used for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.

In the same directory where the provided code and data are, you can run the code:

$ python main.py

(The codes are written in macOS environment. I'm not sure the instructions are right for Windows environment.)
