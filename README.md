## Course project for ECEN 649

1. Environment and Packages

   The code is implemented in Python 3.6.1. 

   To run the code, you need to install 4 packages: numpy, pillow, matplotlib and pickle. Numpy is used for efficient numerical calculations, pillow is used for opening, manipulating, saving image files, and converting images to arrays, matplotlib is for drawing the top 1 feature as required in the project instruction, pickle is used for storing intermediate results.

   There are also several modules used in this code: os, sys, which is used for interacting operating system to input and output data.

2. How to run the code

   In the same directory where the provided code and data are, you can run the code:

   $ python main.py

   (The codes are written in macOS environment. I'm not sure the instructions are right for Windows environment.)

   The results are stored in the same directory named "part1.txt", "part2.txt", "part3.txt"
